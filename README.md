# CPP (C++) Modules - École 42

This repository contains Modules 00-09 of the École 42 C++ curriculum. Each module builds on key C++ concepts, providing a structured approach to mastering object-oriented programming, memory management, and advanced C++ techniques.

## Brief Overview of Modules 00-09

- **CPP Module 00**  
  Introduces the fundamentals of C++ and highlights its unique features compared to C. This module provides an entry point into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), preparing you to work with objects, classes, and encapsulation.

- **CPP Module 01**  
  Focuses on memory management and introduces essential concepts like memory allocation, references, and pointers to members. You’ll also learn how to use the `switch` statement effectively in C++.

- **CPP Module 02**  
  Covers ad-hoc polymorphism and function overloads, as well as the orthodox canonical form for C++ classes. This module will deepen your understanding of flexible function handling.

- **CPP Module 03**  
  Introduces inheritance in C++, exploring how base and derived classes interact, and laying the groundwork for hierarchical class design.

- **CPP Module 04**  
  Focuses on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces, teaching you how to design extensible and modular code using these advanced OOP concepts.

- **CPP Module 05**  
  Emphasizes error handling with `try`/`catch` blocks and exceptions, which are essential for building robust and fault-tolerant applications.

- **CPP Module 06**  
  Explores the different types of casting in C++ (static, dynamic, const, and reinterpret casts), which is crucial for safe and effective type management.

- **CPP Module 07**  
  Introduces templates, which allow for generic programming in C++. This module covers template functions and classes to help you write flexible, reusable code.

- **CPP Module 08**  
  Focuses on templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in the Standard Template Library (STL), providing tools to manage collections and operate on data efficiently.

- **CPP Module 09**  
  Combines topics from previous modules, emphasizing containers and their various applications. This module reinforces the skills acquired throughout the course.
